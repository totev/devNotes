# devNotes of a sleepless coder
This list of excerpts, mind maps, drawings, code examples, doodles and notes of any and all kind are meant for personal use only. If someday somehow someone finds them and has any use of them, then please have a toast with yourself in my name.

If this never happens, I will toast to myself every time I find something useful here, which I would otherwise have had forgotten.

The main reason for this place to exist is the time eating Langolier which is my daughter. Because of her I have wonderful new memories in my head and no place to put stuff learned about tech, which I find interesting but have no time to experiment in the wild with.

All credit goes to the brave and sleepless men and women who shared these insights. I only summed them up and commented it for better personal comprehension. I will try to name them and provide links to the original articles, but if I forget something due to said reasons, then please feel free to do it for me - it's github for Pete's sake.
