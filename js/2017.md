### General list of stuff, that has changed, is now gone, best practices etc. in the glorious and ever changing word of JavaScript.

## Modules
  - use export/import
      - maybe use default export to enable imports without {}
      - import creates an immutable binding
      - use visibility scopes with the index.js trick / export facade
      -


## Operators/functions
  - array/object spread *...*
  - async/awaits - if you like promises, the syntax is less verbose
